# Export a Report's Detail Sections to Separate Excel Sheets

This example demonstrates how to export detail sections of a master-detail report to separate Excel sheets.

![](Images/export-different-report-groups-to-separate-excel-sheets.png)

The report contains information about product categories. The name and description of each category are bound to the controls in the
[Detail](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.UI.DetailBand) band. The name and price of each product are
bound to the controls in the [DetailReport](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.UI.DetailReportBand) band.

On **Print Preview**, product categories span across one or two report pages. To export each product category to a separate sheet of an Excel file, do the following:

1. Set the **DetaiReport** band's [PageBreak](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.UI.Band.PageBreak) property to **AfterBand** to print each product category on a new report page.
2. Set the report's [RollPaper](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.UI.XtraReport.RollPaper) property to **true** to fit each product category to one report page.
3. Set the [ExportMode](https://docs.devexpress.com/CoreLibraries/DevExpress.XtraPrinting.XlsxExportMode) property to **Single File Page By Page** to export each page of the report to a separate Excel sheet.
4. (Optional) Use the [XlSheetCreated](https://docs.devexpress.com/CoreLibraries/DevExpress.XtraPrinting.PrintingSystemBase.XlSheetCreated) event to change the default name of each sheet to the category name.
